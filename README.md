<h3 align="center">Turning Curiosity into Data-Driven Impact</h3>
<h4 align="center">🔎 Data Analyst | SQL | Power BI | Excel</h4>

<p align="center">
My professional journey is a testament to curiosity and adaptability.  
Although not trained in data science through a traditional academic path,  
I discovered early that data is at the heart of every decision, process,  
and opportunity for improvement. This realization sparked a deep interest  
in analytics and problem-solving, leading me to embrace data as both a tool  
and a philosophy for building a better future. Since then, I’ve contributed  
to several impactful projects.
