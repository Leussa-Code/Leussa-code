Turning Curiosity into Data-Driven Impact</h3>
<h2 align="center">
  Data Analyst / SQL / Power BI / Excel </h2>
<p align="center">
My professional journey is a testament to the power of curiosity and adaptability.
Although  not trained in data science through a traditional academic path, I 
discovered early in my career that data is at the heart of every decision, every
process, and every opportunity for improvement. This realization sparked a deep 
interest in analytics and problem-solving, leading to me embracing data as both
a tool and a philosophy for building a better future.
As nature will want it, I officially integrated data analytics into my professional
function marking a new chapter in my career. Since then, I have contributed to 
several impactful projects. </p>
